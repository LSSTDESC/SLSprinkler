To generate the FITS files of the lensed hosts, you will need to run the followi
ng commands only once:

python lensed_hosts/generate_lensed_hosts_agn.py
python lensed_hosts/generate_lensed_hosts_sne.py


The default location of the output is SLSprinkler/lensed_hosts/outputs. Ther
e are 4 subdirectories, called (by default):
"SLSprinkler/lensed_hosts/outputs/agn_lensed_bulges"
"SLSprinkler/lensed_hosts/outputs/agn_lensed_disks"
"SLSprinkler/lensed_hosts/outputs/sne_lensed_bulges"
"SLSprinkler/lensed_hosts/outputs/sne_lensed_disks"

The FITS stamps that are generated are named as "<SystemID>_
<uband_Lensed magnitude>_
<gband_Lensed magnitude>_
<rband_Lensed magnitude>_
<iband_Lensed magnitude>_
<zband_Lensed magnitude>_
<yband_Lensed magnitude>_
bulge/disk>.fits"
